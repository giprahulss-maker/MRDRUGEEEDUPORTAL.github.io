      <br/>SUBJECT:   HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY - I   ( BP101T )  PREPARED BY   –   Mr. Rahul Singh Shaktawat  UNIT   –   I   Post link   -   https://drugee.wordpress.com/2025/08/01/unit - i - 14/  2  Definition of Anatomy:   Anatomy   is the branch of biology concerned with the   study of  the structure of organisms and their parts , especially the human body.  From the textbooks:  •   Tortora &amp; Derrickson (Ch. 1) : "Anatomy is the science of body structures and the  relationships among them."  •   Ross &amp; Wilson : “Anatomy explores how the human body is built, while maintaining  a relationship with its functions.”  •   BD Chaurasia : "Anatomy means cutting up ( dissection ) and refers to the study of  internal   body   parts   through   various   methods   including   cadaveric   study,  microscopy, and imaging."  Types (Branches) of Anatomy:  Each branch gives us a unique view of body structure:  Type of Anatomy   Description   Examples / Applications  Gross Anatomy   Study of structures visible to the naked eye   Muscles, bones, organs  Regional Anatomy   Body studied by areas or regions   Head, chest, abdomen  Systemic Anatomy   Study of specific organ systems   Skeletal, nervous,  digestive systems  Microscopic Anatomy   Structures seen only under a microscope   Cells (cytology), Tissues  (histology)  Developmental  Anatomy  Study of structural changes from fertilization to  adulthood  Embryology, fetal  development  Surface Anatomy   Study of body landmarks on the skin surface   Pulse points, bony  prominences  Radiographic  Anatomy   Structures seen using imaging methods   X - ray, CT, MRI,  ultrasound  Clinical/Applied  Anatomy  Application of anatomical knowledge to clinical  practice  Surgery, diagnosis,  procedures  Comparative  Anatomy   Study of anatomy across species   Research, evolution  studies  Living Anatomy   Study on living subjects using inspection,  palpation, auscultation, and imaging  Bedside examination,  physiotherapy  Ross &amp; Wilson emphasizes the   integration of anatomy with clinical relevance   —  especially through surface anatomy, imaging, and age - related anatomical changes.  Definition of Physiology:   Physiology   is the scientific study of   normal functions   in living  systems — how various body parts work individually and together to sustain life.  From the textbooks:  •   Tortora (Ch. 1) : "Physiology is the science of body functions — how the body parts work."  •   Ross   &amp;   Wilson :   "Physiology   describes   how   the   body   maintains   homeostasis   and  responds to challenges internally and externally."

If  structure is altered, function is often impaired."  Example :  •   The   alveoli   in lungs are thin - walled and numerous,   structurally optimized   for   gas  exchange .  •   If   the   alveolar   walls   thicken   (as   in   fibrosis),   gas   exchange   is   reduced — a  physiological impairment due to structural change .  Tortora explains this as the   “principle of complementarity” .  Scope of Anatomy and Physiology  The scope is   vast and essential   across health sciences:  a)   In Medical Sciences:  •   Diagnostics : Identifying abnormalities (e.g., X - rays in fractures)  •   Surgical planning : Precise knowledge of anatomical relations  •   Pharmacology : Understanding drug actions and physiological effects  b)   In Nursing and Allied Health:  •   Vital signs monitoring : Tied to cardiac and respiratory physiology  •   Patient assessment : Palpation, auscultation, neurological checks  •   Therapeutics : Physiotherapy, nutrition, rehabilitation  c)   In Research and Industry:  •   Medical imaging and device design  •   Pharmaceutical testing  •   Biotechnology and AI in healthcare  7 . Why Study Anatomy and Physiology?  a)   Builds the foundation   for all medical and pharmaceutical sciences.  b)   Prepares for clinical decision - making .  c)   Essential for   diagnosis, therapy, patient education , and   public health .

Levels of Structural Organization in Human Anatomy and Physiology  Introduction :   Understanding   the   hierarchical   structure   of   the   human   body — from  atoms to the complete organism — is essential for grasping how our bodies function. This  framework is called the   levels of structural organization , and it reflects how simple  chemical   units   progressively   combine   to   form   complex   living   systems.  Each level contributes to the form and function of the next level above it, resulting in a  highly integrated, functional human body .  Figure   2 : Pyramid diagram of levels of structural organization in the human  body.  As Tortora states:   “The human body consists of several levels of structural organization that  are built one upon another, from the simplest chemical level to the most complex organismal  level.”   Principles of Anatomy and Physiology   (Tortora, Chapter 1)  a)   Chemical Level   –   The Simplest Level  Definition:   This is the   foundation of all matter , including the human body.  It consists of:  •   Atoms : The smallest units of matter (e.g., Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen)  •   Molecules :   Formed   when   atoms   bond   together   (e.g.,   Water   –   H ₂ O,   Glucose   –  C ₆ H ₁₂ O ₆ , DNA)  Significance:  •   Molecules such as   proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids   form the  structural and functional basis of cells.  •   Enzymes , made from proteins, regulate nearly all chemical reactions.

All physiological functions occur at the cellular level.  Features:  •   Cells contain   organelles   (e.g., nucleus, mitochondria, ribosomes).  •   Different cells perform specialized functions (e.g., muscle cells contract; nerve cells  transmit impulses).  Examples:  •   RBCs   (Red Blood Cells): Carry oxygen  •   Neurons : Transmit signals  •   Myocytes : Facilitate movement  As   BD Chaurasia   explains:   “A cell is a living structural and functional unit of all living  organisms.”   BD Chaurasia’s Handbook of General Anatomy, Ch.1  c)   Tissue Level   –   Similar Cells Working Together  Definition:   A   tissue   is a group of   similar cells   that function together to perform a  particular task.  Major Types:  Type   Function   Example  Epithelial   Covers and protects body surfaces   Skin, lining of intestines  Connective   Supports, binds, and protects organs   Bone, blood, fat tissue  Muscular   Facilitates movement   Skeletal, cardiac muscles  Nervous   Transmits electrical impulses   Brain, spinal cord, nerves  Ross and Wilson classify tissues as “specialized groups of cells and intercellular material  that perform particular functions.”   Ross &amp; Wilson, Ch.3  d)   Organ Level   –   Structures with Specific Functions  Definition:   An   organ   is a structure composed of   two or more different types of tissues  organized to perform specific functions.  Characteristics:  •   Most organs contain   all four tissue types .  •   They are identifiable shapes and functions.  Examples:

To   survive and function  efficiently , it must maintain   internal constancy . This   self - regulating mechanism   is  termed   homeostasis .  Origin of the Term:  •   Coined by   Walter Cannon   in 1926, from the Greek   homeo -   (similar) and   - stasis  (standing still).  •   It   builds   upon   Claude   Bernard’s   concept   of   the   milieu   intérieur   (internal  environment), which emphasizes a stable internal condition essential for life.  Tortora &amp; Derrickson (Ch. 1)   define homeostasis as:   “The condition of equilibrium in the  body’s internal environment due to the constant interaction of the body’s many regulatory  processes.”  Core   Concept   of   Homeostasis :   Homeostasis   involves   maintaining   physical   and  chemical parameters   (called   set points ) within   narrow physiological limits .  Examples include:  •   Body temperature   ≈ 37   ° C  •   Blood glucose   ≈ 90 – 110   mg/dL  •   Blood pH   ≈ 7.35 – 7.45  •   Blood pressure   ≈ 120/80   mmHg  Feedback Mechanisms: The Foundation of Homeostatic Control  Components of a Feedback System  A typical feedback loop includes:  a)   Receptor (Sensor)   –   Detects a change in a variable (stimulus)

It is the   most  common   feedback mechanism.  Goal : Restore equilibrium by   counteracting the change .  Examples :  •   Thermoregulation :  o   Stimulus : Rise in body temperature  o   Receptors : Thermoreceptors in skin  o   Control Center : Hypothalamus  o   Effectors : Sweat glands (increase perspiration); blood vessels (vasodilation)  o   Response : Cooling of the body   ➡   Feedback loop   reverses the deviation   and  shuts off when balance is restored.  •   Blood Glucose Regulation :  o   Stimulus : Rise in blood sugar after a meal  o   Receptors : Beta cells of pancreas  o   Control Center : Pancreas  o   Effectors : Insulin release → cells absorb glucose  o   Response : Blood glucose lowers to normal level  BD   Chaurasia   emphasizes   negative   feedback   as   “a   protective   mechanism   which  defends normal physiological state.”  b)   Positive Feedback  Definition : A mechanism that   amplifies the original stimulus , moving the system away  from its set point until a specific outcome is achieved.  Goal : Intensify the change to   complete a process , then shut off.  Examples :

Characteristics:  •   Body   standing upright  •   Head level , eyes looking forward  •   Arms at the sides ,   palms facing forward  •   Feet flat on the floor,   facing forward  Ross &amp; Wilson   note: “All directional terms refer to the body in the anatomical position,  regardless of its actual posture.”  b)   Directional Terms  Used to describe   location and orientation   of one structure relative to another.  Term   Meaning   Example  Superior (Cranial)   Toward the head   The brain is superior to the heart  Inferior (Caudal)   Toward the feet   The bladder is inferior to the stomach  Anterior (Ventral)   Toward the front   The sternum is anterior to the heart  Posterior (Dorsal)   Toward the back   The spine is posterior to the lungs  Medial   Toward the midline   The nose is medial to the eyes  Lateral   Away from the midline   The lungs are lateral to the heart  Proximal   Closer to the origin or trunk   The elbow is proximal to the wrist  Distal   Farther from the origin or trunk   The fingers are distal to the shoulder  Superficial   Near the surface   The skin is superficial to muscles  Deep   Away from the surface   The kidneys are deep to the abdominal wall  Tortora   highlights: “These terms provide precise and consistent descriptions of body  structure.”  Figure   7 : Anatomical position and commonly used directional terms.

Cell Structure and Functions :   The   cell   is the   structural and functional unit of life .  All organisms, from unicellular bacteria to complex multicellular humans, are composed  of cells. The human body contains approximately   37 trillion cells , all varying in shape,  size, and function — but all sharing common fundamental structures.  Understanding   cell structure and organelle function   is foundational to anatomy and  physiology. From energy production to protein synthesis and genetic control, the cell is  the   biological hub of all life processes .  Tortora &amp; Derrickson   (Chapter 3) state:   “The cell is the smallest unit capable of  performing life processes.”  1 .

Clinical Relevance:  •   Isotonic : Equal solute; no net movement  •   Hypotonic : Water enters cell → lysis  •   Hypertonic : Water exits cell → crenation  BD Chaurasia : “Osmosis is vital for maintaining cell volume and blood osmolarity.”  2 .   Active Transport  Requires ATP (Directly or Indirectly)  Moves substances against concentration gradient  a)   Primary Active Transport:   Direct use of   ATP   to move molecules   from low to high  concentration .  Key example: Na ⁺ /K ⁺ - ATPase Pump  •   3 Na ⁺   ions pumped   out  •   2 K ⁺   ions pumped   in  •   Maintains   membrane potential   and   cell volume  Other Examples:  •   H ⁺ /K ⁺   pump in stomach  •   Ca² ⁺   pump in muscle cells  Tortora :   “Active   pumps   are   critical   for   nerve   impulse   transmission   and   muscle  contraction.”  b)   Secondary Active Transport (Cotransport):   Uses   energy stored in ion gradients  (from primary transport) to move other molecules.  Types:  •   Symport (co - transport) : Same direction  o   Na ⁺   and glucose into intestines  •   Antiport (counter - transport) : Opposite directions  o   Na ⁺   in, Ca ² ⁺   out in cardiac muscle  Ross &amp; Wilson : “Secondary transport couples   metabolic energy indirectly to molecule  movement.”  3 .

Types:  •   Phagocytosis   ("cell eating"): e.g., macrophages engulf bacteria  •   Pinocytosis   ("cell drinking"): nonspecific fluid uptake  •   Receptor - mediated : Specific uptake (e.g., LDL cholesterol)  Mechanism:   Plasma membrane   invaginates , forming a   vesicle   that pinches off inside the  cell.  b)   Exocytosis:   Vesicle fuses   with plasma membrane to   release substances   outside the  cell.

Examples:  •   Neurotransmitter release at synapses  •   Insulin secretion by β - cells  •   Waste expulsion  BD Chaurasia : “Vesicular transport is essential in neurotransmission and immune  defense.”  Flowchart   –   Transport Mechanisms

Anaphase I  •   Homologous chromosomes (each with two chromatids) are pulled to opposite poles.  •   Sister chromatids   remain together   at centromeres.  4.   Telophase I &amp; Cytokinesis  •   Chromosomes reach poles.  •   Cytokinesis occurs →   two haploid cells   (each still with duplicated chromosomes).  •   Nuclear membranes may reform briefly.  End of Meiosis I:   Chromosome number is halved (haploid), but chromatids are still  duplicated.  Meiosis II   –   Equational Division  Purpose:   Sister chromatids separate, similar to mitosis.  1.   Prophase II  •   Chromosomes condense again.  •   New spindle apparatus forms in each haploid cell.  2.   Metaphase II  •   Chromosomes (still X - shaped) align individually at metaphase plate.  •   Spindle fibers attach to kinetochores.  3.   Anaphase II  •   Centromeres split , sister chromatids are pulled apart to opposite poles.  4.   Telophase II &amp; Cytokinesis  •   Chromatids (now individual chromosomes) reach poles.  •   Nuclear envelope reforms, cytokinesis completes.  End of Meiosis II:   From one original cell,   four genetically distinct haploid cells   are  produced.

Location Examples  •   Embryonic development   (e.g., Notch - Delta signaling)  •   Immune response   (e.g., T - cell and antigen - presenting cell interaction)  •   Cardiac tissue : Gap junctions coordinate synchronized contraction  Function  •   Facilitates   highly specific, localized communication .  •   Enables   synchronous cell behavior   (e.g., in cardiac or smooth muscle).  •   Regulates   cell fate decisions   during development.  b)   Paracrine Signaling  Mechanism  •   Cells   release   signaling   molecules   (e.g.,   cytokines,   growth   factors)   into   the  extracellular fluid .  •   These affect   neighboring target cells   within the same tissue or organ.  •   Signals are usually   short - lived   due to rapid uptake, degradation, or diffusion limits.  Location Examples  •   Local inflammation   (e.g., histamine release)  •   Wound healing   (e.g., fibroblast growth factors)  •   Organ development   (e.g., Sonic Hedgehog pathway)  Function  •   Coordinates   local tissue responses  •   Controls   tissue regeneration ,   immune cell recruitment , and   angiogenesis  c)   Synaptic Signaling  Mechanism  •   Specialized form of paracrine signaling.  •   Neurons transmit electrical impulses   that trigger release of   neurotransmitters  into the   synaptic cleft .  •   Neurotransmitters bind to receptors on adjacent neuron or muscle cells.

It forms protective layers on body surfaces, lines internal cavities and  organs, and constitutes glands. These tissues are   highly cellular , meaning cells are  closely packed with minimal extracellular material.

This matrix separates the relatively few connective tissue cells and determines the tissue’s  physical properties , such as rigidity, elasticity, and resistance to compression.  The   three major structural components   of all connective tissues are:  ➢   Cells  ➢   Fibers  ➢   Ground Substance  Figure   31 : Structural components of connective tissue .  Together,   fibers + ground substance   form the   extracellular matrix (ECM) , which is the  functional and mechanical foundation of connective tissues.  i.   Cells of Connective Tissue :   The   types of cells   vary depending on the connective tissue  type (e.g., loose, dense, bone, blood).  These cells can be divided into:  A. Fixed (Resident) Cells :   Stay in the tissue for extended periods; involved in matrix  production and maintenance.  Cell Type   Description &amp; Function  Fibroblasts   Most abundant cells in connective tissue proper. Secrete collagen, elastin,  ground substance. Maintain ECM.

NOTE : Different connective tissues have specialized cells:  •   Chondrocytes   in cartilage  •   Osteocytes   in bone  •   RBCs/WBCs/platelets   in blood  ii.   Fibers   o f Connective Tissue :   Fibers are   long protein polymers   embedded in the  ECM, produced by fibroblasts (or chondrocytes in cartilage, osteoblasts in bone). They  determine   tensile strength ,   elasticity , and   structural integrity   of the tissue.  A. Collagen Fibers  •   Most abundant protein in the body (~25 – 30% of total protein).  •   Composed of   collagen type I   (in tendons, bone, dermis), type II (cartilage), or type  III (reticular fibers).  •   Function : Provide tensile strength (resist stretching forces).  •   Appearance   in histology: Thick, wavy bundles, pink - stained in H&amp;E.  Example : Dense regular CT (tendons) has parallel collagen bundles for unidirectional  strength.  B. Elastic Fibers  •   Composed of   elastin and fibrillin .  •   Allow tissues to   stretch and recoil   like a rubber band.  •   Found in organs that undergo frequent deformation (e.g., arteries, lungs, skin).  •   Appearance   in histology: Thin, branching fibers; special stains (e.g., Verhoeff or  Orcein) are used to see them clearly.

Composition  •   Water : Main component  •   Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) : Highly negatively charged, attract water  o   e.g., Hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate  •   Proteoglycans : Core protein + GAG chains (e.g., aggrecan)  •   Glycoproteins : Fibronectin, laminin (for cell adhesion)  B. Functions  •   Hydration : Holds water like a sponge — provides resistance to compression  •   Diffusion : Allows nutrient and waste exchange between cells and capillaries  •   Barrier : Slows pathogen spread  •   Adhesion : Anchors cells to ECM (via integrins and glycoproteins)  In cartilage, the ground substance is   firm and rubbery   (due to high GAG content), while  in blood, it's   fluid   (plasma).

Connective   Tissue   Proper :   This includes tissues that   bind   organs   and support  epithelia , subdivided into   loose   and   dense   connective tissues based on fiber density.  A. Loose Connective Tissue   ( Fewer fibers , more ground substance, highly cellular )  Loose connective tissue is the   most widely distributed type of connective tissue   in the  human body. It is characterized by a   loose arrangement of fibers (collagen, elastic, and  reticular)   embedded   in   a   gel - like   ground   substance ,   with   abundant   cells   such   as  fibroblasts and immune cells.  Because of its soft, pliable nature and rich vascular supply, it   fills spaces between  organs, cushions tissues, provides support, and serves as a medium for nutrient and  waste exchange .  A. 1. Areolar Connective Tissue  Figure 3 2 : Loose   (Areolar) connective tissue.  •   Structure :   Loosely   arranged   collagen,   elastic,   and   reticular   fibers ;   fibroblasts  dominate with macrophages, mast cells, and some white blood cells.  •   Function : Cushions organs, supports epithelium, allows diffusion.  •   Location :   Papillary   dermis,   around   blood   vessels,   nerves,   and   organs;   lamina  propria of mucous membranes.  •   Histology : Meshwork appearance; visible nuclei of fibroblasts; collagen and elastic  fibers scattered.  A. 2. Adipose Tissue  •   Structure : Dominated by adipocytes with peripheral nuclei; very little ECM.  •   Function : Energy storage, thermal insulation, protection (shock absorption).  •   Types :  o   White fat : Found in adults (e.g., hypodermis, omentum).

Figure 3 3 : Adipose tissue.  A. 3. Reticular Tissue  Figure   34 : Reticular connective tissue.  •   Structure :   Network   of   thin   reticular   fibers   (type   III   collagen)   and   fibroblasts  (reticular cells).  •   Function : Provides soft internal framework for lymphoid organs.  •   Location : Spleen, lymph nodes, bone marrow.  •   Histology : Reticular fibers seen with silver stains; loosely arranged supporting cells.  B. Dense Connective Tissue   ( More collagen fibers, less ground substance, fewer cells  (mostly fibroblasts) )  Dense connective tissue is a specialized form of connective tissue characterized by a   high  proportion of closely packed collagen fibers   with relatively fewer cells and ground  substance.  It is designed to   provide strong structural support and resist tensile forces , making it  a key component of tendons, ligaments, and the dermis of the skin.

Figure 3 5 : Dense connective tissue types.  B. 1. Dense Regular Connective Tissue  •   Structure :   Collagen   fibers   arranged   in   parallel   bundles;   fibroblasts   squeezed  between fibers.  •   Function : Withstands tensile stress in one direction.  •   Location : Tendons, ligaments, aponeuroses.  •   Histology : Wavy collagen fibers in one direction; nuclei flattened between bundles.  B. 2. Dense Irregular Connective Tissue  •   Structure : Irregularly arranged collagen fibers; scattered fibroblasts.  •   Function : Withstands stress in multiple directions.  •   Location : Reticular dermis, fibrous capsules of organs and joints, periosteum,  perichondrium.  •   Histology : Densely packed collagen fibers in many directions.  B. 3. Elastic Connective Tissue  •   Structure : Abundant elastic fibers; some collagen; fibroblasts between fibers.  •   Function : Allows stretching and recoil.  •   Location : Walls of large arteries (e.g., aorta), vocal cords, bronchial tubes.  •   Histology : Wavy, dark - stained elastic fibers (special stains like Verhoeff's).  ii . Specialized Connective Tissue :   This group includes tissues with   distinct properties  and specialized functions , including   cartilage ,   bone , and   blood .  A. Cartilage   ( Avascular tissue with firm but flexible matrix )  •   Matrix : High in chondroitin sulfate, proteoglycans, and water.  •   Cells : Chondrocytes in   lacunae ; chondroblasts in growing cartilage.

This tissue is highly  vascularized ,   excitable ,   contractile ,   extensible ,   and   elastic ,   enabling   the   body   to  perform   voluntary and involuntary movements .  As per Tortora &amp; Derrickson : “Muscle tissue consists of elongated cells, or fibers , that  can use ATP to generate force. It produces body movements, maintains posture, and  generates heat.”  There are   three major types   of muscle tissue:  ➢   Skeletal Muscle  ➢   Cardiac Muscle  ➢   Smooth Muscle  Figure   41 : Microscopic comparison of skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle  tissue.  3.1   Skeletal Muscle Tissue :   Skeletal muscle tissue   is the   most abundant   type of  muscle in the human body, making up about   40 – 50% of total body mass   in adults. It is  voluntary, striated, multinucleated , and is under the control of the   somatic nervous  system .  Main function:   Producing   conscious, voluntary movements ,   postural support , and  thermogenesis   (heat generation through shivering).

It is the   smallest repeating unit   in muscle fibers that actively generates force.  Defined as:   “The region of a myofibril between two adjacent   Z - lines , composed of  overlapping   thick (myosin)   and   thin (actin)   filaments that produce contraction via a  sliding mechanism.”  Structural Components of   t he Sarcomere :   A sarcomere is ~ 2.2 micrometers long   (in  resting muscle) and is organized in a   precise arrangement   of overlapping   thick and thin  filaments . This structure is what gives   skeletal muscle its striated appearance   under  the microscope.

Titin (Connectin)  •   Largest known protein   in the human body  •   Spans from   Z - line to M - line  •   Anchors   thick filament (myosin)   and provides   elastic recoil  Without titin, sarcomeres would lose alignment and elasticity.  Sarcomere Changes During Contraction :   According to the   Sliding Filament Theory ,  sarcomere shortens not by shrinking filaments, but by increasing overlap.  Region   During Contraction  Z - lines   Move closer together  I - band   Becomes narrower  H - zone   Shrinks or disappears  A - band   Remains unchanged  Sarcomere length   Overall   shortens  ATP and calcium are essential to this sliding mechanism.  Excitation - Contraction Coupling and Sarcomere Function  a)   Initiation:  •   Action potential reaches   neuromuscular junction .  •   Acetylcholine (ACh)   is released and binds receptors on sarcolemma.  •   Impulse travels through   T - tubules   to sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR).  b)   Calcium Release:  •   SR releases   Ca² ⁺   into sarcoplasm.  •   Ca² ⁺   binds to Troponin - C   → tropomyosin shifts → exposes actin's active sites.  c)   Cross - Bridge Formation:  •   Myosin head binds actin , forming cross - bridge.  d)   Power Stroke:  •   Myosin head pivots → pulls actin toward M - line.  •   ADP + Pi   released.

Cardiomyocytes (Muscle Fibers)  Description:  •   Each cardiac muscle fiber is a   single cell   called a   cardiomyocyte .  •   Cells are   shorter   than skeletal muscle fibers and often   branch   to connect with  adjacent fibers.  •   The fiber length typically ranges from   50 – 100 μm , and width from   10 – 20 μm .  Nucleus:  •   One centrally located nucleus   per cell is typical.  •   Some cells may be   binucleated , especially in aged tissue.  •   Surrounding the nucleus is a   perinuclear clear area , which contains   glycogen  (unstained in H&amp;E slides).  ii . Intercalated Discs (Hallmark Feature)  Appearance:  •   Visible under light microscopy as   thick, dark transverse lines   across muscle  fibers.  •   Run   perpendicular to the long axis   of the cells.  •   Give cardiac muscle its   "stepped" or "zigzag" junction   appearance.  Composition:  Intercalated discs are   complex cell junctions , made of:  Component   Function  Desmosomes   Anchor adjacent cells together (mechanical adhesion)  Fascia adherens   Connect actin filaments to the sarcolemma  Gap junctions   Allow direct passage of   ions and small molecules   → electrical coupling  These junctions allow the myocardium to act as a   functional syncytium , ensuring all  cardiomyocytes contract   as a unit .  iii . Striations and Sarcomeres  •   Like skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle shows   cross - striations   due to   sarcomere  arrangement .

Myofibrils and Sarcoplasmic Reticulum (SR)  Component   Cardiac Muscle Feature  Myofibrils   Parallel bundles of sarcomeres; give rise to striations  Sarcoplasmic Reticulum  (SR)   Less well - developed than in skeletal muscle  T - tubules   Present;   larger , located at   Z - lines   (vs. A - I junction in skeletal muscle)  Calcium storage   SR stores some calcium, but   extracellular Ca² ⁺   is essential   for  contraction  Diads   1 T - tubule + 1 SR cisterna   (not triads as in skeletal muscle)  v . Mitochondria &amp; Energy Supply  •   Numerous large mitochondria   (occupying ~40% of cytoplasm)  •   Densely packed between myofibrils  •   High   aerobic metabolism — cardiac muscle relies almost exclusively on   oxidative  phosphorylation  •   Cells also contain   myoglobin   (red oxygen - binding pigment)  This rich mitochondrial content gives cardiac muscle a   high fatigue resistance , essential  for continuous heart function.  vi . Cytoplasmic Inclusions  Inclusion   Function / Feature  Glycogen granules   Provide fuel; accumulate around nucleus (clear halo seen)  Lipofuscin   Aging pigment; often accumulates around the nucleus  vii . Functional Syncytium  •   Although   each   cell   has   its   own   nucleus   and   membrane,   gap   junctions   in  intercalated discs allow ions to pass directly between cells.  •   This allows the myocardium to behave as   one electrically connected unit .  Important for synchronized contraction of the atria and ventricles.  viii .

It is   non - striated ,   involuntary , and composed of  spindle - shaped cells   with a   single, central nucleus . Unlike skeletal and cardiac muscle,  smooth muscle   lacks sarcomeres   but still contracts using   actin and myosin filaments .  Tortora &amp; Derrickson :   “Smooth muscle tissue is found in the walls of hollow internal  structures and is usually activated involuntarily. Its fibers do not exhibit striations under  the microscope.”  Figure 4 6 : Smooth muscle tissue.  3.3.1   Characteristics  Feature   Smooth Muscle  Control   Involuntary (Autonomic Nervous System, hormones, local factors)  Appearance   Non - striated, uniform, fusiform (spindle - shaped) cells  Nucleus   Single, elongated, centrally placed  Striations   Absent (no visible sarcomeres)  Location   Found in walls of hollow organs (e.g., GI tract, blood vessels)  Contraction   Slow, sustained, and energy - efficient  Regeneration   Good regenerative capacity   via mitosis  3.3.2   Microscopic Structure of Smooth Muscle Tissue :   Unlike skeletal and cardiac  muscle,   smooth muscle lacks striations   under the light microscope. This is due to the  irregular arrangement   of actin and myosin filaments, which are   not organized into  sarcomeres .   Despite this, smooth muscle cells are highly specialized and efficient for  slow, sustained, and rhythmic contractions .  3.3.3   Microscopic Features of Smooth Muscle  Feature   Description  Cell shape   Spindle - shaped (fusiform) : wide in the middle, tapering at both ends  Nucleus   Single, elongated, centrally located nucleus  Striations   Absent   –   no sarcomeres, hence uniform appearance  Cytoplasm   Eosinophilic   (pink in H&amp;E), homogeneous without cross - striations  Cell arrangement   Closely packed , arranged in sheets or bundles; nuclei appear staggered  Junctions   Gap junctions   (unitary type) enable coordinated contractions

A . Cell Shape and Arrangement  •   Spindle (fusiform) : The cells are narrow at the ends and thicker in the center, with  blunt ends .  •   In longitudinal sections, cells   overlap , and their   nuclei appear cigar - shaped .  •   In transverse (cross) sections, cells appear   small and round , and not all contain  visible nuclei (as not every section hits the nucleus).  B . Nucleus  •   Each smooth muscle cell contains   a single, centrally located nucleus .  •   In a   relaxed state , the nucleus appears   elongated .  •   During   contraction , the nucleus can become   twisted or corkscrew - shaped , a  classic identifying feature.  C . Cytoplasm and Organelles  •   Smooth muscle cytoplasm stains   pale pink   (eosinophilic)   in H&amp;E due to the  abundance of   actin and myosin .  •   It appears   homogenous   because   contractile proteins   are dispersed throughout  and   not aligned   in repeating patterns.  •   Organelles (mitochondria, Golgi, ribosomes) are concentrated near the nucleus.  •   Cells are surrounded by a   basal lamina , and often enclosed in   endomysium   (fine  connective tissue layer).  D . Contractile Apparatus  Smooth   muscle   lacks   sarcomeres ,   but   contraction   still   occurs   via   actin – myosin  interaction, organized differently:  Component   Function  Actin   Anchored to   dense bodies ; thin filaments  Myosin   Interacts with actin for contraction; thick filaments

E . Surface Specializations   –   Caveolae  •   Smooth muscle   lacks T - tubules , unlike skeletal and cardiac muscle.  •   Instead, the plasma membrane has   invaginations   called   caveolae .  •   These act as   calcium entry points   and help in   signal transduction , functioning  similarly to T - tubules but more primitive.  F . Gap Junctions (in Unitary Smooth Muscle)  •   Cells   in   visceral   smooth   muscle   are   connected   by   gap   junctions ,   forming   a  functional syncytium .  •   Gap junctions allow the   spread of ions and electrical impulses , so cells   contract  as a single unit .  •   Especially important in the   GI tract ,   bladder , and   uterus .  3.3.4   Histological Identification Under Light Microscope  Section Type   Appearance  Longitudinal   Spindle - shaped cells with elongated nuclei; no striations  Cross - section   Circular or oval profiles; some cells may lack visible nuclei (due to sectioning)  Staining   Cytoplasm is pink; nucleus stains basophilic (blue - purple) in H&amp;E  Microscopic appearance is generally   more uniform and less organized   than skeletal or  cardiac muscle.

Unlike skeletal muscle, which is  organized in bundles of parallel fibers attached to bones, smooth muscle is typically  organized in   sheets, layers, or bundles   within the   walls of hollow organs .  Figure   48 :   Organization of smooth muscle in tissues .  ➢   Concepts of Organization  •   Smooth muscle is not arranged into fascicles like skeletal muscle .  •   Its arrangement depends on the   mechanical function   of the organ.  •   It may be organized in   circular ,   longitudinal ,   oblique , or even   spiral layers   to  coordinate complex movements   like peristalsis, sphincter closure, or uterine  contractions.  ➢   Layered Arrangements in Hollow Organs  The   most   common   and   functionally   significant   arrangement   is   the   dual - layered  structure :  A.   Inner Circular Layer  •   Muscle fibers   are arranged in a circular manner   around the lumen   of the organ.  •   When these fibers   contract , they   narrow the lumen   of the organ.  •   Found in:  o   Esophagus, intestines   (peristalsis)  o   Blood vessels   (vasoconstriction)  o   Bronchi   (bronchoconstriction)  o   Iris of the eye   (pupil constriction)  Function : Decreases lumen diameter, important for   propulsion and restriction of flow .  B . Outer Longitudinal Layer  •   Fibers run   along the length   of the organ.  •   When these fibers   contract , they   shorten the organ .

C . Additional Oblique or Spiral Layers (in some organs)  •   Present in organs that require   multi - directional movement or force .  •   Example:   Stomach  o   Has   three layers : inner oblique, middle circular, outer longitudinal.  o   This enhances the   churning and mixing   of food with digestive enzymes.  Example: GI Tract Wall  Layer   Smooth Muscle Arrangement   Function  Mucosa (innermost)   —   Secretion and absorption  Muscularis mucosae   Thin   circular smooth muscle   Maintains mucosal tone  Muscularis externa   Inner circular + outer longitudinal   Peristalsis   and   segmentation  Serosa/Adventitia   —   Outer connective tissue  Between the two layers of the muscularis externa lies the   myenteric (Auerbach’s) plexus ,  part of the   enteric nervous system , which controls smooth muscle contractions.  ➢   Functional Importance of Layering  Organ   Layer Arrangement   Function Enabled  Esophagus   Circular + longitudinal   Propel food toward stomach via peristalsis  Intestines   Circular + longitudinal   Mix and move contents along tract  Uterus   Circular + longitudinal (dense  meshwork)  Strong, multidirectional contractions during  childbirth  Urinary  bladder   Interwoven network   Uniform contraction to expel urine  Stomach   Oblique + circular + longitudinal   Churning and mixing food with enzymes  Blood vessels   Circular only (mainly)   Control of vessel diameter (blood pressure  regulation)  Iris of eye   Radial and circular layers   Pupil dilation and constriction  ➢   Microscopy of Smooth Muscle Organization  A.   In Longitudinal Section:  •   Muscle cells appear   long and fusiform , with   elongated nuclei .  •   Layers are seen   running in a single direction   (depending on the organ section).  B.   In Cross - section:  •   Cells appear   circular or oval , with or without visible nuclei depending on the cut.  •   Multiple layers   appear stacked concentrically in tubular organs.

It is the   main tissue of the  nervous system , which includes the   brain ,   spinal cord , and   peripheral nerves .  Nervous tissue is highly specialized for:  •   Communication  •   Integration  •   Coordination of bodily functions  It accomplishes this through two main types of cells:  a)   Neurons   –   the excitable, signal - transmitting cells  b)   Neuroglia (Glial cells)   –   the supporting, insulating, and protective cells  Neurons   send and receive signals;   neuroglia   take care of them.  a)   Neurons :   Neurons , also known as   nerve cells , are the   fundamental units of the  nervous system . They are specialized for the   generation ,   conduction , and   transmission  of   electrical and chemical signals   throughout the body.  Neurons serve three major roles:  •   Receiving stimuli   from internal and external environments  •   Processing (integrating)   the information  •   Sending signals   to effectors (muscles, glands, or other neurons)  These cells form   complex neural networks   that underlie everything from reflexes to  thoughts.  ➢   Histogenesis   (Origin of Neurons)  •   Embryologically, neurons are derived from the   ectoderm , specifically from the  neural tube   and   neural crest .  •   Neuroblasts   differentiate into mature neurons, which   lose their ability to divide  after development (except in specific brain regions like the hippocampus).  ➢   Structure of a Neuron :   Neurons are   highly polarized , meaning their structures are  functionally and structurally distinct .

      <br/>SUBJECT:   HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY - I   ( BP101T )  PREPARED BY   –   Mr. Rahul Singh Shaktawat  UNIT   –   I   Post link   -   https://drugee.wordpress.com/2025/08/01/unit - i - 14/  2  Definition of Anatomy:   Anatomy   is the branch of biology concerned with the   study of  the structure of organisms and their parts , especially the human body.  From the textbooks:  •   Tortora &amp; Derrickson (Ch. 1) : "Anatomy is the science of body structures and the  relationships among them."  •   Ross &amp; Wilson : “Anatomy explores how the human body is built, while maintaining  a relationship with its functions.”  •   BD Chaurasia : "Anatomy means cutting up ( dissection ) and refers to the study of  internal   body   parts   through   various   methods   including   cadaveric   study,  microscopy, and imaging."  Types (Branches) of Anatomy:  Each branch gives us a unique view of body structure:  Type of Anatomy   Description   Examples / Applications  Gross Anatomy   Study of structures visible to the naked eye   Muscles, bones, organs  Regional Anatomy   Body studied by areas or regions   Head, chest, abdomen  Systemic Anatomy   Study of specific organ systems   Skeletal, nervous,  digestive systems  Microscopic Anatomy   Structures seen only under a microscope   Cells (cytology), Tissues  (histology)  Developmental  Anatomy  Study of structural changes from fertilization to  adulthood  Embryology, fetal  development  Surface Anatomy   Study of body landmarks on the skin surface   Pulse points, bony  prominences  Radiographic  Anatomy   Structures seen using imaging methods   X - ray, CT, MRI,  ultrasound  Clinical/Applied  Anatomy  Application of anatomical knowledge to clinical  practice  Surgery, diagnosis,  procedures  Comparative  Anatomy   Study of anatomy across species   Research, evolution  studies  Living Anatomy   Study on living subjects using inspection,  palpation, auscultation, and imaging  Bedside examination,  physiotherapy  Ross &amp; Wilson emphasizes the   integration of anatomy with clinical relevance   —  especially through surface anatomy, imaging, and age - related anatomical changes.  Definition of Physiology:   Physiology   is the scientific study of   normal functions   in living  systems — how various body parts work individually and together to sustain life.  From the textbooks:  •   Tortora (Ch. 1) : "Physiology is the science of body functions — how the body parts work."  •   Ross   &amp;   Wilson :   "Physiology   describes   how   the   body   maintains   homeostasis   and  responds to challenges internally and externally."

If  structure is altered, function is often impaired."  Example :  •   The   alveoli   in lungs are thin - walled and numerous,   structurally optimized   for   gas  exchange .  •   If   the   alveolar   walls   thicken   (as   in   fibrosis),   gas   exchange   is   reduced — a  physiological impairment due to structural change .  Tortora explains this as the   “principle of complementarity” .  Scope of Anatomy and Physiology  The scope is   vast and essential   across health sciences:  a)   In Medical Sciences:  •   Diagnostics : Identifying abnormalities (e.g., X - rays in fractures)  •   Surgical planning : Precise knowledge of anatomical relations  •   Pharmacology : Understanding drug actions and physiological effects  b)   In Nursing and Allied Health:  •   Vital signs monitoring : Tied to cardiac and respiratory physiology  •   Patient assessment : Palpation, auscultation, neurological checks  •   Therapeutics : Physiotherapy, nutrition, rehabilitation  c)   In Research and Industry:  •   Medical imaging and device design  •   Pharmaceutical testing  •   Biotechnology and AI in healthcare  7 . Why Study Anatomy and Physiology?  a)   Builds the foundation   for all medical and pharmaceutical sciences.  b)   Prepares for clinical decision - making .  c)   Essential for   diagnosis, therapy, patient education , and   public health .

Levels of Structural Organization in Human Anatomy and Physiology  Introduction :   Understanding   the   hierarchical   structure   of   the   human   body — from  atoms to the complete organism — is essential for grasping how our bodies function. This  framework is called the   levels of structural organization , and it reflects how simple  chemical   units   progressively   combine   to   form   complex   living   systems.  Each level contributes to the form and function of the next level above it, resulting in a  highly integrated, functional human body .  Figure   2 : Pyramid diagram of levels of structural organization in the human  body.  As Tortora states:   “The human body consists of several levels of structural organization that  are built one upon another, from the simplest chemical level to the most complex organismal  level.”   Principles of Anatomy and Physiology   (Tortora, Chapter 1)  a)   Chemical Level   –   The Simplest Level  Definition:   This is the   foundation of all matter , including the human body.  It consists of:  •   Atoms : The smallest units of matter (e.g., Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen)  •   Molecules :   Formed   when   atoms   bond   together   (e.g.,   Water   –   H ₂ O,   Glucose   –  C ₆ H ₁₂ O ₆ , DNA)  Significance:  •   Molecules such as   proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids   form the  structural and functional basis of cells.  •   Enzymes , made from proteins, regulate nearly all chemical reactions.

To   survive and function  efficiently , it must maintain   internal constancy . This   self - regulating mechanism   is  termed   homeostasis .  Origin of the Term:  •   Coined by   Walter Cannon   in 1926, from the Greek   homeo -   (similar) and   - stasis  (standing still).  •   It   builds   upon   Claude   Bernard’s   concept   of   the   milieu   intérieur   (internal  environment), which emphasizes a stable internal condition essential for life.  Tortora &amp; Derrickson (Ch. 1)   define homeostasis as:   “The condition of equilibrium in the  body’s internal environment due to the constant interaction of the body’s many regulatory  processes.”  Core   Concept   of   Homeostasis :   Homeostasis   involves   maintaining   physical   and  chemical parameters   (called   set points ) within   narrow physiological limits .  Examples include:  •   Body temperature   ≈ 37   ° C  •   Blood glucose   ≈ 90 – 110   mg/dL  •   Blood pH   ≈ 7.35 – 7.45  •   Blood pressure   ≈ 120/80   mmHg  Feedback Mechanisms: The Foundation of Homeostatic Control  Components of a Feedback System  A typical feedback loop includes:  a)   Receptor (Sensor)   –   Detects a change in a variable (stimulus)

It is the   most  common   feedback mechanism.  Goal : Restore equilibrium by   counteracting the change .  Examples :  •   Thermoregulation :  o   Stimulus : Rise in body temperature  o   Receptors : Thermoreceptors in skin  o   Control Center : Hypothalamus  o   Effectors : Sweat glands (increase perspiration); blood vessels (vasodilation)  o   Response : Cooling of the body   ➡   Feedback loop   reverses the deviation   and  shuts off when balance is restored.  •   Blood Glucose Regulation :  o   Stimulus : Rise in blood sugar after a meal  o   Receptors : Beta cells of pancreas  o   Control Center : Pancreas  o   Effectors : Insulin release → cells absorb glucose  o   Response : Blood glucose lowers to normal level  BD   Chaurasia   emphasizes   negative   feedback   as   “a   protective   mechanism   which  defends normal physiological state.”  b)   Positive Feedback  Definition : A mechanism that   amplifies the original stimulus , moving the system away  from its set point until a specific outcome is achieved.  Goal : Intensify the change to   complete a process , then shut off.  Examples :

Characteristics:  •   Body   standing upright  •   Head level , eyes looking forward  •   Arms at the sides ,   palms facing forward  •   Feet flat on the floor,   facing forward  Ross &amp; Wilson   note: “All directional terms refer to the body in the anatomical position,  regardless of its actual posture.”  b)   Directional Terms  Used to describe   location and orientation   of one structure relative to another.  Term   Meaning   Example  Superior (Cranial)   Toward the head   The brain is superior to the heart  Inferior (Caudal)   Toward the feet   The bladder is inferior to the stomach  Anterior (Ventral)   Toward the front   The sternum is anterior to the heart  Posterior (Dorsal)   Toward the back   The spine is posterior to the lungs  Medial   Toward the midline   The nose is medial to the eyes  Lateral   Away from the midline   The lungs are lateral to the heart  Proximal   Closer to the origin or trunk   The elbow is proximal to the wrist  Distal   Farther from the origin or trunk   The fingers are distal to the shoulder  Superficial   Near the surface   The skin is superficial to muscles  Deep   Away from the surface   The kidneys are deep to the abdominal wall  Tortora   highlights: “These terms provide precise and consistent descriptions of body  structure.”  Figure   7 : Anatomical position and commonly used directional terms.

Cell Structure and Functions :   The   cell   is the   structural and functional unit of life .  All organisms, from unicellular bacteria to complex multicellular humans, are composed  of cells. The human body contains approximately   37 trillion cells , all varying in shape,  size, and function — but all sharing common fundamental structures.  Understanding   cell structure and organelle function   is foundational to anatomy and  physiology. From energy production to protein synthesis and genetic control, the cell is  the   biological hub of all life processes .  Tortora &amp; Derrickson   (Chapter 3) state:   “The cell is the smallest unit capable of  performing life processes.”  1 .

Passive Transport  Does not require ATP  Depends on concentration gradients  a)   Simple Diffusion:   Movement of   small, non - polar   molecules   directly across   the lipid  bilayer   from high to low concentration .  Examples:  •   O ₂   and CO ₂   exchange in alveoli  •   Movement of steroid hormones  Factors influencing diffusion:  •   Concentration gradient  •   Membrane permeability  •   Temperature  •   Surface area  Ross &amp; Wilson : “Diffusion is the primary mechanism of gas exchange in the body.”  b)   Facilitated   Diffusion:   Movement   of   larger   or   charged   molecules   via   transport  proteins , down the concentration gradient.  Types:  •   Channel - mediated : Ion channels (e.g., Na ⁺ , K ⁺ , Cl ⁻ )  •   Carrier - mediated : Glucose transporters (e.g., GLUT - 1 in RBCs)  Examples:  •   Entry of glucose into cells (non - insulin sensitive)  •   Ion passage in nerve cells  Tortora : “Facilitated diffusion is a saturable, protein - dependent process.”  c)   Osmosis:   Movement of   water   through a selectively permeable membrane from   low  solute concentration to high solute concentration .

Clinical Relevance:  •   Isotonic : Equal solute; no net movement  •   Hypotonic : Water enters cell → lysis  •   Hypertonic : Water exits cell → crenation  BD Chaurasia : “Osmosis is vital for maintaining cell volume and blood osmolarity.”  2 .   Active Transport  Requires ATP (Directly or Indirectly)  Moves substances against concentration gradient  a)   Primary Active Transport:   Direct use of   ATP   to move molecules   from low to high  concentration .  Key example: Na ⁺ /K ⁺ - ATPase Pump  •   3 Na ⁺   ions pumped   out  •   2 K ⁺   ions pumped   in  •   Maintains   membrane potential   and   cell volume  Other Examples:  •   H ⁺ /K ⁺   pump in stomach  •   Ca² ⁺   pump in muscle cells  Tortora :   “Active   pumps   are   critical   for   nerve   impulse   transmission   and   muscle  contraction.”  b)   Secondary Active Transport (Cotransport):   Uses   energy stored in ion gradients  (from primary transport) to move other molecules.  Types:  •   Symport (co - transport) : Same direction  o   Na ⁺   and glucose into intestines  •   Antiport (counter - transport) : Opposite directions  o   Na ⁺   in, Ca ² ⁺   out in cardiac muscle  Ross &amp; Wilson : “Secondary transport couples   metabolic energy indirectly to molecule  movement.”  3 .

It forms protective layers on body surfaces, lines internal cavities and  organs, and constitutes glands. These tissues are   highly cellular , meaning cells are  closely packed with minimal extracellular material.  Tortora &amp; Derrickson   describe epithelium as "a continuous sheet of cells that forms the  lining of body surfaces, cavities, and glands, providing both protection and functional  specialization."  1.1   Functions   o f Epithelial Tissue  ➢   Protection   –   against mechanical, chemical, and microbial stress (skin, oral mucosa)  ➢   Absorption   –   nutrients and ions (intestines, renal tubules)  ➢   Secretion   –   hormones, enzymes, mucus (glands, stomach)  ➢   Excretion   –   wastes via kidney tubules  ➢   Filtration   –   blood plasma in renal glomeruli  ➢   Sensory reception   –   olfactory epithelium, taste buds  ➢   Surface movement   –   cilia sweep mucus/debris (respiratory epithelium)  1.2   General Features of Epithelial Tissue

This matrix separates the relatively few connective tissue cells and determines the tissue’s  physical properties , such as rigidity, elasticity, and resistance to compression.  The   three major structural components   of all connective tissues are:  ➢   Cells  ➢   Fibers  ➢   Ground Substance  Figure   31 : Structural components of connective tissue .  Together,   fibers + ground substance   form the   extracellular matrix (ECM) , which is the  functional and mechanical foundation of connective tissues.  i.   Cells of Connective Tissue :   The   types of cells   vary depending on the connective tissue  type (e.g., loose, dense, bone, blood).  These cells can be divided into:  A. Fixed (Resident) Cells :   Stay in the tissue for extended periods; involved in matrix  production and maintenance.

Fibers   o f Connective Tissue :   Fibers are   long protein polymers   embedded in the  ECM, produced by fibroblasts (or chondrocytes in cartilage, osteoblasts in bone). They  determine   tensile strength ,   elasticity , and   structural integrity   of the tissue.  A. Collagen Fibers  •   Most abundant protein in the body (~25 – 30% of total protein).  •   Composed of   collagen type I   (in tendons, bone, dermis), type II (cartilage), or type  III (reticular fibers).  •   Function : Provide tensile strength (resist stretching forces).  •   Appearance   in histology: Thick, wavy bundles, pink - stained in H&amp;E.  Example : Dense regular CT (tendons) has parallel collagen bundles for unidirectional  strength.  B. Elastic Fibers  •   Composed of   elastin and fibrillin .  •   Allow tissues to   stretch and recoil   like a rubber band.  •   Found in organs that undergo frequent deformation (e.g., arteries, lungs, skin).  •   Appearance   in histology: Thin, branching fibers; special stains (e.g., Verhoeff or  Orcein) are used to see them clearly.

It acts as a   molecular sieve ,  allowing the exchange of nutrients, gases, and wastes between cells and blood.  A. Composition  •   Water : Main component  •   Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) : Highly negatively charged, attract water  o   e.g., Hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate  •   Proteoglycans : Core protein + GAG chains (e.g., aggrecan)  •   Glycoproteins : Fibronectin, laminin (for cell adhesion)  B. Functions  •   Hydration : Holds water like a sponge — provides resistance to compression  •   Diffusion : Allows nutrient and waste exchange between cells and capillaries  •   Barrier : Slows pathogen spread  •   Adhesion : Anchors cells to ECM (via integrins and glycoproteins)  In cartilage, the ground substance is   firm and rubbery   (due to high GAG content), while  in blood, it's   fluid   (plasma).

Connective   Tissue   Proper :   This includes tissues that   bind   organs   and support  epithelia , subdivided into   loose   and   dense   connective tissues based on fiber density.  A. Loose Connective Tissue   ( Fewer fibers , more ground substance, highly cellular )  Loose connective tissue is the   most widely distributed type of connective tissue   in the  human body. It is characterized by a   loose arrangement of fibers (collagen, elastic, and  reticular)   embedded   in   a   gel - like   ground   substance ,   with   abundant   cells   such   as  fibroblasts and immune cells.  Because of its soft, pliable nature and rich vascular supply, it   fills spaces between  organs, cushions tissues, provides support, and serves as a medium for nutrient and  waste exchange .  A. 1. Areolar Connective Tissue  Figure 3 2 : Loose   (Areolar) connective tissue.  •   Structure :   Loosely   arranged   collagen,   elastic,   and   reticular   fibers ;   fibroblasts  dominate with macrophages, mast cells, and some white blood cells.  •   Function : Cushions organs, supports epithelium, allows diffusion.  •   Location :   Papillary   dermis,   around   blood   vessels,   nerves,   and   organs;   lamina  propria of mucous membranes.  •   Histology : Meshwork appearance; visible nuclei of fibroblasts; collagen and elastic  fibers scattered.  A. 2. Adipose Tissue  •   Structure : Dominated by adipocytes with peripheral nuclei; very little ECM.  •   Function : Energy storage, thermal insulation, protection (shock absorption).  •   Types :  o   White fat : Found in adults (e.g., hypodermis, omentum).

Figure 3 3 : Adipose tissue.  A. 3. Reticular Tissue  Figure   34 : Reticular connective tissue.  •   Structure :   Network   of   thin   reticular   fibers   (type   III   collagen)   and   fibroblasts  (reticular cells).  •   Function : Provides soft internal framework for lymphoid organs.  •   Location : Spleen, lymph nodes, bone marrow.  •   Histology : Reticular fibers seen with silver stains; loosely arranged supporting cells.  B. Dense Connective Tissue   ( More collagen fibers, less ground substance, fewer cells  (mostly fibroblasts) )  Dense connective tissue is a specialized form of connective tissue characterized by a   high  proportion of closely packed collagen fibers   with relatively fewer cells and ground  substance.

It is the   smallest repeating unit   in muscle fibers that actively generates force.  Defined as:   “The region of a myofibril between two adjacent   Z - lines , composed of  overlapping   thick (myosin)   and   thin (actin)   filaments that produce contraction via a  sliding mechanism.”  Structural Components of   t he Sarcomere :   A sarcomere is ~ 2.2 micrometers long   (in  resting muscle) and is organized in a   precise arrangement   of overlapping   thick and thin  filaments . This structure is what gives   skeletal muscle its striated appearance   under  the microscope.

Cardiomyocytes (Muscle Fibers)  Description:  •   Each cardiac muscle fiber is a   single cell   called a   cardiomyocyte .  •   Cells are   shorter   than skeletal muscle fibers and often   branch   to connect with  adjacent fibers.  •   The fiber length typically ranges from   50 – 100 μm , and width from   10 – 20 μm .  Nucleus:  •   One centrally located nucleus   per cell is typical.  •   Some cells may be   binucleated , especially in aged tissue.  •   Surrounding the nucleus is a   perinuclear clear area , which contains   glycogen  (unstained in H&amp;E slides).  ii . Intercalated Discs (Hallmark Feature)  Appearance:  •   Visible under light microscopy as   thick, dark transverse lines   across muscle  fibers.  •   Run   perpendicular to the long axis   of the cells.  •   Give cardiac muscle its   "stepped" or "zigzag" junction   appearance.  Composition:  Intercalated discs are   complex cell junctions , made of:  Component   Function  Desmosomes   Anchor adjacent cells together (mechanical adhesion)  Fascia adherens   Connect actin filaments to the sarcolemma  Gap junctions   Allow direct passage of   ions and small molecules   → electrical coupling  These junctions allow the myocardium to act as a   functional syncytium , ensuring all  cardiomyocytes contract   as a unit .  iii . Striations and Sarcomeres  •   Like skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle shows   cross - striations   due to   sarcomere  arrangement .

It is   non - striated ,   involuntary , and composed of  spindle - shaped cells   with a   single, central nucleus . Unlike skeletal and cardiac muscle,  smooth muscle   lacks sarcomeres   but still contracts using   actin and myosin filaments .  Tortora &amp; Derrickson :   “Smooth muscle tissue is found in the walls of hollow internal  structures and is usually activated involuntarily. Its fibers do not exhibit striations under  the microscope.”  Figure 4 6 : Smooth muscle tissue.  3.3.1   Characteristics  Feature   Smooth Muscle  Control   Involuntary (Autonomic Nervous System, hormones, local factors)  Appearance   Non - striated, uniform, fusiform (spindle - shaped) cells  Nucleus   Single, elongated, centrally placed  Striations   Absent (no visible sarcomeres)  Location   Found in walls of hollow organs (e.g., GI tract, blood vessels)  Contraction   Slow, sustained, and energy - efficient  Regeneration   Good regenerative capacity   via mitosis  3.3.2   Microscopic Structure of Smooth Muscle Tissue :   Unlike skeletal and cardiac  muscle,   smooth muscle lacks striations   under the light microscope. This is due to the  irregular arrangement   of actin and myosin filaments, which are   not organized into  sarcomeres .   Despite this, smooth muscle cells are highly specialized and efficient for  slow, sustained, and rhythmic contractions .  3.3.3   Microscopic Features of Smooth Muscle  Feature   Description  Cell shape   Spindle - shaped (fusiform) : wide in the middle, tapering at both ends  Nucleus   Single, elongated, centrally located nucleus  Striations   Absent   –   no sarcomeres, hence uniform appearance  Cytoplasm   Eosinophilic   (pink in H&amp;E), homogeneous without cross - striations  Cell arrangement   Closely packed , arranged in sheets or bundles; nuclei appear staggered  Junctions   Gap junctions   (unitary type) enable coordinated contractions

A . Cell Shape and Arrangement  •   Spindle (fusiform) : The cells are narrow at the ends and thicker in the center, with  blunt ends .  •   In longitudinal sections, cells   overlap , and their   nuclei appear cigar - shaped .  •   In transverse (cross) sections, cells appear   small and round , and not all contain  visible nuclei (as not every section hits the nucleus).  B . Nucleus  •   Each smooth muscle cell contains   a single, centrally located nucleus .  •   In a   relaxed state , the nucleus appears   elongated .  •   During   contraction , the nucleus can become   twisted or corkscrew - shaped , a  classic identifying feature.  C . Cytoplasm and Organelles  •   Smooth muscle cytoplasm stains   pale pink   (eosinophilic)   in H&amp;E due to the  abundance of   actin and myosin .  •   It appears   homogenous   because   contractile proteins   are dispersed throughout  and   not aligned   in repeating patterns.  •   Organelles (mitochondria, Golgi, ribosomes) are concentrated near the nucleus.  •   Cells are surrounded by a   basal lamina , and often enclosed in   endomysium   (fine  connective tissue layer).  D . Contractile Apparatus  Smooth   muscle   lacks   sarcomeres ,   but   contraction   still   occurs   via   actin – myosin  interaction, organized differently:  Component   Function  Actin   Anchored to   dense bodies ; thin filaments  Myosin   Interacts with actin for contraction; thick filaments

E . Surface Specializations   –   Caveolae  •   Smooth muscle   lacks T - tubules , unlike skeletal and cardiac muscle.  •   Instead, the plasma membrane has   invaginations   called   caveolae .  •   These act as   calcium entry points   and help in   signal transduction , functioning  similarly to T - tubules but more primitive.  F . Gap Junctions (in Unitary Smooth Muscle)  •   Cells   in   visceral   smooth   muscle   are   connected   by   gap   junctions ,   forming   a  functional syncytium .  •   Gap junctions allow the   spread of ions and electrical impulses , so cells   contract  as a single unit .  •   Especially important in the   GI tract ,   bladder , and   uterus .  3.3.4   Histological Identification Under Light Microscope  Section Type   Appearance  Longitudinal   Spindle - shaped cells with elongated nuclei; no striations  Cross - section   Circular or oval profiles; some cells may lack visible nuclei (due to sectioning)  Staining   Cytoplasm is pink; nucleus stains basophilic (blue - purple) in H&amp;E  Microscopic appearance is generally   more uniform and less organized   than skeletal or  cardiac muscle.

Unlike skeletal muscle, which is  organized in bundles of parallel fibers attached to bones, smooth muscle is typically  organized in   sheets, layers, or bundles   within the   walls of hollow organs .  Figure   48 :   Organization of smooth muscle in tissues .  ➢   Concepts of Organization  •   Smooth muscle is not arranged into fascicles like skeletal muscle .  •   Its arrangement depends on the   mechanical function   of the organ.  •   It may be organized in   circular ,   longitudinal ,   oblique , or even   spiral layers   to  coordinate complex movements   like peristalsis, sphincter closure, or uterine  contractions.  ➢   Layered Arrangements in Hollow Organs  The   most   common   and   functionally   significant   arrangement   is   the   dual - layered  structure :  A.   Inner Circular Layer  •   Muscle fibers   are arranged in a circular manner   around the lumen   of the organ.  •   When these fibers   contract , they   narrow the lumen   of the organ.  •   Found in:  o   Esophagus, intestines   (peristalsis)  o   Blood vessels   (vasoconstriction)  o   Bronchi   (bronchoconstriction)  o   Iris of the eye   (pupil constriction)  Function : Decreases lumen diameter, important for   propulsion and restriction of flow .  B . Outer Longitudinal Layer  •   Fibers run   along the length   of the organ.  •   When these fibers   contract , they   shorten the organ .

C . Additional Oblique or Spiral Layers (in some organs)  •   Present in organs that require   multi - directional movement or force .  •   Example:   Stomach  o   Has   three layers : inner oblique, middle circular, outer longitudinal.  o   This enhances the   churning and mixing   of food with digestive enzymes.  Example: GI Tract Wall  Layer   Smooth Muscle Arrangement   Function  Mucosa (innermost)   —   Secretion and absorption  Muscularis mucosae   Thin   circular smooth muscle   Maintains mucosal tone  Muscularis externa   Inner circular + outer longitudinal   Peristalsis   and   segmentation  Serosa/Adventitia   —   Outer connective tissue  Between the two layers of the muscularis externa lies the   myenteric (Auerbach’s) plexus ,  part of the   enteric nervous system , which controls smooth muscle contractions.  ➢   Functional Importance of Layering  Organ   Layer Arrangement   Function Enabled  Esophagus   Circular + longitudinal   Propel food toward stomach via peristalsis  Intestines   Circular + longitudinal   Mix and move contents along tract  Uterus   Circular + longitudinal (dense  meshwork)  Strong, multidirectional contractions during  childbirth  Urinary  bladder   Interwoven network   Uniform contraction to expel urine  Stomach   Oblique + circular + longitudinal   Churning and mixing food with enzymes  Blood vessels   Circular only (mainly)   Control of vessel diameter (blood pressure  regulation)  Iris of eye   Radial and circular layers   Pupil dilation and constriction  ➢   Microscopy of Smooth Muscle Organization  A.   In Longitudinal Section:  •   Muscle cells appear   long and fusiform , with   elongated nuclei .  •   Layers are seen   running in a single direction   (depending on the organ section).  B.   In Cross - section:  •   Cells appear   circular or oval , with or without visible nuclei depending on the cut.  •   Multiple layers   appear stacked concentrically in tubular organs.

It is the   main tissue of the  nervous system , which includes the   brain ,   spinal cord , and   peripheral nerves .  Nervous tissue is highly specialized for:  •   Communication  •   Integration  •   Coordination of bodily functions  It accomplishes this through two main types of cells:  a)   Neurons   –   the excitable, signal - transmitting cells  b)   Neuroglia (Glial cells)   –   the supporting, insulating, and protective cells  Neurons   send and receive signals;   neuroglia   take care of them.  a)   Neurons :   Neurons , also known as   nerve cells , are the   fundamental units of the  nervous system . They are specialized for the   generation ,   conduction , and   transmission  of   electrical and chemical signals   throughout the body.  Neurons serve three major roles:  •   Receiving stimuli   from internal and external environments  •   Processing (integrating)   the information  •   Sending signals   to effectors (muscles, glands, or other neurons)  These cells form   complex neural networks   that underlie everything from reflexes to  thoughts.  ➢   Histogenesis   (Origin of Neurons)  •   Embryologically, neurons are derived from the   ectoderm , specifically from the  neural tube   and   neural crest .  •   Neuroblasts   differentiate into mature neurons, which   lose their ability to divide  after development (except in specific brain regions like the hippocampus).  ➢   Structure of a Neuron :   Neurons are   highly polarized , meaning their structures are  functionally and structurally distinct .

      <br/>SUBJECT:   HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY - I   ( BP101T )  PREPARED BY   –   Mr. Rahul Singh Shaktawat  UNIT   –   I   Post link   -   https://drugee.wordpress.com/2025/08/01/unit - i - 14/  2  Definition of Anatomy:   Anatomy   is the branch of biology concerned with the   study of  the structure of organisms and their parts , especially the human body.  From the textbooks:  •   Tortora &amp; Derrickson (Ch. 1) : "Anatomy is the science of body structures and the  relationships among them."  •   Ross &amp; Wilson : “Anatomy explores how the human body is built, while maintaining  a relationship with its functions.”  •   BD Chaurasia : "Anatomy means cutting up ( dissection ) and refers to the study of  internal   body   parts   through   various   methods   including   cadaveric   study,  microscopy, and imaging."  Types (Branches) of Anatomy:  Each branch gives us a unique view of body structure:  Type of Anatomy   Description   Examples / Applications  Gross Anatomy   Study of structures visible to the naked eye   Muscles, bones, organs  Regional Anatomy   Body studied by areas or regions   Head, chest, abdomen  Systemic Anatomy   Study of specific organ systems   Skeletal, nervous,  digestive systems  Microscopic Anatomy   Structures seen only under a microscope   Cells (cytology), Tissues  (histology)  Developmental  Anatomy  Study of structural changes from fertilization to  adulthood  Embryology, fetal  development  Surface Anatomy   Study of body landmarks on the skin surface   Pulse points, bony  prominences  Radiographic  Anatomy   Structures seen using imaging methods   X - ray, CT, MRI,  ultrasound  Clinical/Applied  Anatomy  Application of anatomical knowledge to clinical  practice  Surgery, diagnosis,  procedures  Comparative  Anatomy   Study of anatomy across species   Research, evolution  studies  Living Anatomy   Study on living subjects using inspection,  palpation, auscultation, and imaging  Bedside examination,  physiotherapy  Ross &amp; Wilson emphasizes the   integration of anatomy with clinical relevance   —  especially through surface anatomy, imaging, and age - related anatomical changes.  Definition of Physiology:   Physiology   is the scientific study of   normal functions   in living  systems — how various body parts work individually and together to sustain life.  From the textbooks:  •   Tortora (Ch. 1) : "Physiology is the science of body functions — how the body parts work."  •   Ross   &amp;   Wilson :   "Physiology   describes   how   the   body   maintains   homeostasis   and  responds to challenges internally and externally."

If  structure is altered, function is often impaired."  Example :  •   The   alveoli   in lungs are thin - walled and numerous,   structurally optimized   for   gas  exchange .  •   If   the   alveolar   walls   thicken   (as   in   fibrosis),   gas   exchange   is   reduced — a  physiological impairment due to structural change .  Tortora explains this as the   “principle of complementarity” .  Scope of Anatomy and Physiology  The scope is   vast and essential   across health sciences:  a)   In Medical Sciences:  •   Diagnostics : Identifying abnormalities (e.g., X - rays in fractures)  •   Surgical planning : Precise knowledge of anatomical relations  •   Pharmacology : Understanding drug actions and physiological effects  b)   In Nursing and Allied Health:  •   Vital signs monitoring : Tied to cardiac and respiratory physiology  •   Patient assessment : Palpation, auscultation, neurological checks  •   Therapeutics : Physiotherapy, nutrition, rehabilitation  c)   In Research and Industry:  •   Medical imaging and device design  •   Pharmaceutical testing  •   Biotechnology and AI in healthcare  7 . Why Study Anatomy and Physiology?  a)   Builds the foundation   for all medical and pharmaceutical sciences.  b)   Prepares for clinical decision - making .  c)   Essential for   diagnosis, therapy, patient education , and   public health .

Levels of Structural Organization in Human Anatomy and Physiology  Introduction :   Understanding   the   hierarchical   structure   of   the   human   body — from  atoms to the complete organism — is essential for grasping how our bodies function. This  framework is called the   levels of structural organization , and it reflects how simple  chemical   units   progressively   combine   to   form   complex   living   systems.  Each level contributes to the form and function of the next level above it, resulting in a  highly integrated, functional human body .  Figure   2 : Pyramid diagram of levels of structural organization in the human  body.  As Tortora states:   “The human body consists of several levels of structural organization that  are built one upon another, from the simplest chemical level to the most complex organismal  level.”   Principles of Anatomy and Physiology   (Tortora, Chapter 1)  a)   Chemical Level   –   The Simplest Level  Definition:   This is the   foundation of all matter , including the human body.  It consists of:  •   Atoms : The smallest units of matter (e.g., Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen)  •   Molecules :   Formed   when   atoms   bond   together   (e.g.,   Water   –   H ₂ O,   Glucose   –  C ₆ H ₁₂ O ₆ , DNA)  Significance:  •   Molecules such as   proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids   form the  structural and functional basis of cells.  •   Enzymes , made from proteins, regulate nearly all chemical reactions.

All physiological functions occur at the cellular level.  Features:  •   Cells contain   organelles   (e.g., nucleus, mitochondria, ribosomes).  •   Different cells perform specialized functions (e.g., muscle cells contract; nerve cells  transmit impulses).  Examples:  •   RBCs   (Red Blood Cells): Carry oxygen  •   Neurons : Transmit signals  •   Myocytes : Facilitate movement  As   BD Chaurasia   explains:   “A cell is a living structural and functional unit of all living  organisms.”   BD Chaurasia’s Handbook of General Anatomy, Ch.1  c)   Tissue Level   –   Similar Cells Working Together  Definition:   A   tissue   is a group of   similar cells   that function together to perform a  particular task.  Major Types:  Type   Function   Example  Epithelial   Covers and protects body surfaces   Skin, lining of intestines  Connective   Supports, binds, and protects organs   Bone, blood, fat tissue  Muscular   Facilitates movement   Skeletal, cardiac muscles  Nervous   Transmits electrical impulses   Brain, spinal cord, nerves  Ross and Wilson classify tissues as “specialized groups of cells and intercellular material  that perform particular functions.”   Ross &amp; Wilson, Ch.3  d)   Organ Level   –   Structures with Specific Functions  Definition:   An   organ   is a structure composed of   two or more different types of tissues  organized to perform specific functions.  Characteristics:  •   Most organs contain   all four tissue types .  •   They are identifiable shapes and functions.  Examples:

To   survive and function  efficiently , it must maintain   internal constancy . This   self - regulating mechanism   is  termed   homeostasis .  Origin of the Term:  •   Coined by   Walter Cannon   in 1926, from the Greek   homeo -   (similar) and   - stasis  (standing still).  •   It   builds   upon   Claude   Bernard’s   concept   of   the   milieu   intérieur   (internal  environment), which emphasizes a stable internal condition essential for life.  Tortora &amp; Derrickson (Ch. 1)   define homeostasis as:   “The condition of equilibrium in the  body’s internal environment due to the constant interaction of the body’s many regulatory  processes.”  Core   Concept   of   Homeostasis :   Homeostasis   involves   maintaining   physical   and  chemical parameters   (called   set points ) within   narrow physiological limits .  Examples include:  •   Body temperature   ≈ 37   ° C  •   Blood glucose   ≈ 90 – 110   mg/dL  •   Blood pH   ≈ 7.35 – 7.45  •   Blood pressure   ≈ 120/80   mmHg  Feedback Mechanisms: The Foundation of Homeostatic Control  Components of a Feedback System  A typical feedback loop includes:  a)   Receptor (Sensor)   –   Detects a change in a variable (stimulus)

It is the   most  common   feedback mechanism.  Goal : Restore equilibrium by   counteracting the change .  Examples :  •   Thermoregulation :  o   Stimulus : Rise in body temperature  o   Receptors : Thermoreceptors in skin  o   Control Center : Hypothalamus  o   Effectors : Sweat glands (increase perspiration); blood vessels (vasodilation)  o   Response : Cooling of the body   ➡   Feedback loop   reverses the deviation   and  shuts off when balance is restored.  •   Blood Glucose Regulation :  o   Stimulus : Rise in blood sugar after a meal  o   Receptors : Beta cells of pancreas  o   Control Center : Pancreas  o   Effectors : Insulin release → cells absorb glucose  o   Response : Blood glucose lowers to normal level  BD   Chaurasia   emphasizes   negative   feedback   as   “a   protective   mechanism   which  defends normal physiological state.”  b)   Positive Feedback  Definition : A mechanism that   amplifies the original stimulus , moving the system away  from its set point until a specific outcome is achieved.  Goal : Intensify the change to   complete a process , then shut off.  Examples :

Characteristics:  •   Body   standing upright  •   Head level , eyes looking forward  •   Arms at the sides ,   palms facing forward  •   Feet flat on the floor,   facing forward  Ross &amp; Wilson   note: “All directional terms refer to the body in the anatomical position,  regardless of its actual posture.”  b)   Directional Terms  Used to describe   location and orientation   of one structure relative to another.  Term   Meaning   Example  Superior (Cranial)   Toward the head   The brain is superior to the heart  Inferior (Caudal)   Toward the feet   The bladder is inferior to the stomach  Anterior (Ventral)   Toward the front   The sternum is anterior to the heart  Posterior (Dorsal)   Toward the back   The spine is posterior to the lungs  Medial   Toward the midline   The nose is medial to the eyes  Lateral   Away from the midline   The lungs are lateral to the heart  Proximal   Closer to the origin or trunk   The elbow is proximal to the wrist  Distal   Farther from the origin or trunk   The fingers are distal to the shoulder  Superficial   Near the surface   The skin is superficial to muscles  Deep   Away from the surface   The kidneys are deep to the abdominal wall  Tortora   highlights: “These terms provide precise and consistent descriptions of body  structure.”  Figure   7 : Anatomical position and commonly used directional terms.

Cell Structure and Functions :   The   cell   is the   structural and functional unit of life .  All organisms, from unicellular bacteria to complex multicellular humans, are composed  of cells. The human body contains approximately   37 trillion cells , all varying in shape,  size, and function — but all sharing common fundamental structures.  Understanding   cell structure and organelle function   is foundational to anatomy and  physiology. From energy production to protein synthesis and genetic control, the cell is  the   biological hub of all life processes .

Location Examples  •   Embryonic development   (e.g., Notch - Delta signaling)  •   Immune response   (e.g., T - cell and antigen - presenting cell interaction)  •   Cardiac tissue : Gap junctions coordinate synchronized contraction  Function  •   Facilitates   highly specific, localized communication .  •   Enables   synchronous cell behavior   (e.g., in cardiac or smooth muscle).  •   Regulates   cell fate decisions   during development.  b)   Paracrine Signaling  Mechanism  •   Cells   release   signaling   molecules   (e.g.,   cytokines,   growth   factors)   into   the  extracellular fluid .  •   These affect   neighboring target cells   within the same tissue or organ.  •   Signals are usually   short - lived   due to rapid uptake, degradation, or diffusion limits.  Location Examples  •   Local inflammation   (e.g., histamine release)  •   Wound healing   (e.g., fibroblast growth factors)  •   Organ development   (e.g., Sonic Hedgehog pathway)  Function  •   Coordinates   local tissue responses  •   Controls   tissue regeneration ,   immune cell recruitment , and   angiogenesis  c)   Synaptic Signaling  Mechanism  •   Specialized form of paracrine signaling.  •   Neurons transmit electrical impulses   that trigger release of   neurotransmitters  into the   synaptic cleft .  •   Neurotransmitters bind to receptors on adjacent neuron or muscle cells.

It forms protective layers on body surfaces, lines internal cavities and  organs, and constitutes glands. These tissues are   highly cellular , meaning cells are  closely packed with minimal extracellular material.  Tortora &amp; Derrickson   describe epithelium as "a continuous sheet of cells that forms the  lining of body surfaces, cavities, and glands, providing both protection and functional  specialization."  1.1   Functions   o f Epithelial Tissue  ➢   Protection   –   against mechanical, chemical, and microbial stress (skin, oral mucosa)  ➢   Absorption   –   nutrients and ions (intestines, renal tubules)  ➢   Secretion   –   hormones, enzymes, mucus (glands, stomach)  ➢   Excretion   –   wastes via kidney tubules  ➢   Filtration   –   blood plasma in renal glomeruli  ➢   Sensory reception   –   olfactory epithelium, taste buds  ➢   Surface movement   –   cilia sweep mucus/debris (respiratory epithelium)  1.2   General Features of Epithelial Tissue

This matrix separates the relatively few connective tissue cells and determines the tissue’s  physical properties , such as rigidity, elasticity, and resistance to compression.  The   three major structural components   of all connective tissues are:  ➢   Cells  ➢   Fibers  ➢   Ground Substance  Figure   31 : Structural components of connective tissue .  Together,   fibers + ground substance   form the   extracellular matrix (ECM) , which is the  functional and mechanical foundation of connective tissues.  i.   Cells of Connective Tissue :   The   types of cells   vary depending on the connective tissue  type (e.g., loose, dense, bone, blood).  These cells can be divided into:  A. Fixed (Resident) Cells :   Stay in the tissue for extended periods; involved in matrix  production and maintenance.

Connective   Tissue   Proper :   This includes tissues that   bind   organs   and support  epithelia , subdivided into   loose   and   dense   connective tissues based on fiber density.  A. Loose Connective Tissue   ( Fewer fibers , more ground substance, highly cellular )  Loose connective tissue is the   most widely distributed type of connective tissue   in the  human body. It is characterized by a   loose arrangement of fibers (collagen, elastic, and  reticular)   embedded   in   a   gel - like   ground   substance ,   with   abundant   cells   such   as  fibroblasts and immune cells.  Because of its soft, pliable nature and rich vascular supply, it   fills spaces between  organs, cushions tissues, provides support, and serves as a medium for nutrient and  waste exchange .  A. 1. Areolar Connective Tissue  Figure 3 2 : Loose   (Areolar) connective tissue.  •   Structure :   Loosely   arranged   collagen,   elastic,   and   reticular   fibers ;   fibroblasts  dominate with macrophages, mast cells, and some white blood cells.  •   Function : Cushions organs, supports epithelium, allows diffusion.  •   Location :   Papillary   dermis,   around   blood   vessels,   nerves,   and   organs;   lamina  propria of mucous membranes.  •   Histology : Meshwork appearance; visible nuclei of fibroblasts; collagen and elastic  fibers scattered.  A. 2. Adipose Tissue  •   Structure : Dominated by adipocytes with peripheral nuclei; very little ECM.  •   Function : Energy storage, thermal insulation, protection (shock absorption).  •   Types :  o   White fat : Found in adults (e.g., hypodermis, omentum).

Figure 3 3 : Adipose tissue.  A. 3. Reticular Tissue  Figure   34 : Reticular connective tissue.  •   Structure :   Network   of   thin   reticular   fibers   (type   III   collagen)   and   fibroblasts  (reticular cells).  •   Function : Provides soft internal framework for lymphoid organs.  •   Location : Spleen, lymph nodes, bone marrow.  •   Histology : Reticular fibers seen with silver stains; loosely arranged supporting cells.  B. Dense Connective Tissue   ( More collagen fibers, less ground substance, fewer cells  (mostly fibroblasts) )  Dense connective tissue is a specialized form of connective tissue characterized by a   high  proportion of closely packed collagen fibers   with relatively fewer cells and ground  substance.  It is designed to   provide strong structural support and resist tensile forces , making it  a key component of tendons, ligaments, and the dermis of the skin.

As per Tortora &amp; Derrickson : “Muscle tissue consists of elongated cells, or fibers , that  can use ATP to generate force. It produces body movements, maintains posture, and  generates heat.”  There are   three major types   of muscle tissue:  ➢   Skeletal Muscle  ➢   Cardiac Muscle  ➢   Smooth Muscle  Figure   41 : Microscopic comparison of skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle  tissue.  3.1   Skeletal Muscle Tissue :   Skeletal muscle tissue   is the   most abundant   type of  muscle in the human body, making up about   40 – 50% of total body mass   in adults. It is  voluntary, striated, multinucleated , and is under the control of the   somatic nervous  system .  Main function:   Producing   conscious, voluntary movements ,   postural support , and  thermogenesis   (heat generation through shivering).

Cardiomyocytes (Muscle Fibers)  Description:  •   Each cardiac muscle fiber is a   single cell   called a   cardiomyocyte .  •   Cells are   shorter   than skeletal muscle fibers and often   branch   to connect with  adjacent fibers.  •   The fiber length typically ranges from   50 – 100 μm , and width from   10 – 20 μm .  Nucleus:  •   One centrally located nucleus   per cell is typical.  •   Some cells may be   binucleated , especially in aged tissue.  •   Surrounding the nucleus is a   perinuclear clear area , which contains   glycogen  (unstained in H&amp;E slides).  ii . Intercalated Discs (Hallmark Feature)  Appearance:  •   Visible under light microscopy as   thick, dark transverse lines   across muscle  fibers.  •   Run   perpendicular to the long axis   of the cells.  •   Give cardiac muscle its   "stepped" or "zigzag" junction   appearance.  Composition:  Intercalated discs are   complex cell junctions , made of:  Component   Function  Desmosomes   Anchor adjacent cells together (mechanical adhesion)  Fascia adherens   Connect actin filaments to the sarcolemma  Gap junctions   Allow direct passage of   ions and small molecules   → electrical coupling  These junctions allow the myocardium to act as a   functional syncytium , ensuring all  cardiomyocytes contract   as a unit .  iii . Striations and Sarcomeres  •   Like skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle shows   cross - striations   due to   sarcomere  arrangement .

Myofibrils and Sarcoplasmic Reticulum (SR)  Component   Cardiac Muscle Feature  Myofibrils   Parallel bundles of sarcomeres; give rise to striations  Sarcoplasmic Reticulum  (SR)   Less well - developed than in skeletal muscle  T - tubules   Present;   larger , located at   Z - lines   (vs. A - I junction in skeletal muscle)  Calcium storage   SR stores some calcium, but   extracellular Ca² ⁺   is essential   for  contraction  Diads   1 T - tubule + 1 SR cisterna   (not triads as in skeletal muscle)  v . Mitochondria &amp; Energy Supply  •   Numerous large mitochondria   (occupying ~40% of cytoplasm)  •   Densely packed between myofibrils  •   High   aerobic metabolism — cardiac muscle relies almost exclusively on   oxidative  phosphorylation  •   Cells also contain   myoglobin   (red oxygen - binding pigment)  This rich mitochondrial content gives cardiac muscle a   high fatigue resistance , essential  for continuous heart function.  vi . Cytoplasmic Inclusions  Inclusion   Function / Feature  Glycogen granules   Provide fuel; accumulate around nucleus (clear halo seen)  Lipofuscin   Aging pigment; often accumulates around the nucleus  vii . Functional Syncytium  •   Although   each   cell   has   its   own   nucleus   and   membrane,   gap   junctions   in  intercalated discs allow ions to pass directly between cells.  •   This allows the myocardium to behave as   one electrically connected unit .  Important for synchronized contraction of the atria and ventricles.  viii .

It is   non - striated ,   involuntary , and composed of  spindle - shaped cells   with a   single, central nucleus . Unlike skeletal and cardiac muscle,  smooth muscle   lacks sarcomeres   but still contracts using   actin and myosin filaments .  Tortora &amp; Derrickson :   “Smooth muscle tissue is found in the walls of hollow internal  structures and is usually activated involuntarily. Its fibers do not exhibit striations under  the microscope.”  Figure 4 6 : Smooth muscle tissue.  3.3.1   Characteristics  Feature   Smooth Muscle  Control   Involuntary (Autonomic Nervous System, hormones, local factors)  Appearance   Non - striated, uniform, fusiform (spindle - shaped) cells  Nucleus   Single, elongated, centrally placed  Striations   Absent (no visible sarcomeres)  Location   Found in walls of hollow organs (e.g., GI tract, blood vessels)  Contraction   Slow, sustained, and energy - efficient  Regeneration   Good regenerative capacity   via mitosis  3.3.2   Microscopic Structure of Smooth Muscle Tissue :   Unlike skeletal and cardiac  muscle,   smooth muscle lacks striations   under the light microscope. This is due to the  irregular arrangement   of actin and myosin filaments, which are   not organized into  sarcomeres .   Despite this, smooth muscle cells are highly specialized and efficient for  slow, sustained, and rhythmic contractions .  3.3.3   Microscopic Features of Smooth Muscle  Feature   Description  Cell shape   Spindle - shaped (fusiform) : wide in the middle, tapering at both ends  Nucleus   Single, elongated, centrally located nucleus  Striations   Absent   –   no sarcomeres, hence uniform appearance  Cytoplasm   Eosinophilic   (pink in H&amp;E), homogeneous without cross - striations  Cell arrangement   Closely packed , arranged in sheets or bundles; nuclei appear staggered  Junctions   Gap junctions   (unitary type) enable coordinated contractions

A . Cell Shape and Arrangement  •   Spindle (fusiform) : The cells are narrow at the ends and thicker in the center, with  blunt ends .  •   In longitudinal sections, cells   overlap , and their   nuclei appear cigar - shaped .  •   In transverse (cross) sections, cells appear   small and round , and not all contain  visible nuclei (as not every section hits the nucleus).  B . Nucleus  •   Each smooth muscle cell contains   a single, centrally located nucleus .  •   In a   relaxed state , the nucleus appears   elongated .  •   During   contraction , the nucleus can become   twisted or corkscrew - shaped , a  classic identifying feature.  C . Cytoplasm and Organelles  •   Smooth muscle cytoplasm stains   pale pink   (eosinophilic)   in H&amp;E due to the  abundance of   actin and myosin .  •   It appears   homogenous   because   contractile proteins   are dispersed throughout  and   not aligned   in repeating patterns.  •   Organelles (mitochondria, Golgi, ribosomes) are concentrated near the nucleus.  •   Cells are surrounded by a   basal lamina , and often enclosed in   endomysium   (fine  connective tissue layer).  D . Contractile Apparatus  Smooth   muscle   lacks   sarcomeres ,   but   contraction   still   occurs   via   actin – myosin  interaction, organized differently:  Component   Function  Actin   Anchored to   dense bodies ; thin filaments  Myosin   Interacts with actin for contraction; thick filaments

E . Surface Specializations   –   Caveolae  •   Smooth muscle   lacks T - tubules , unlike skeletal and cardiac muscle.  •   Instead, the plasma membrane has   invaginations   called   caveolae .  •   These act as   calcium entry points   and help in   signal transduction , functioning  similarly to T - tubules but more primitive.  F . Gap Junctions (in Unitary Smooth Muscle)  •   Cells   in   visceral   smooth   muscle   are   connected   by   gap   junctions ,   forming   a  functional syncytium .  •   Gap junctions allow the   spread of ions and electrical impulses , so cells   contract  as a single unit .  •   Especially important in the   GI tract ,   bladder , and   uterus .  3.3.4   Histological Identification Under Light Microscope  Section Type   Appearance  Longitudinal   Spindle - shaped cells with elongated nuclei; no striations  Cross - section   Circular or oval profiles; some cells may lack visible nuclei (due to sectioning)  Staining   Cytoplasm is pink; nucleus stains basophilic (blue - purple) in H&amp;E  Microscopic appearance is generally   more uniform and less organized   than skeletal or  cardiac muscle.

Unlike skeletal muscle, which is  organized in bundles of parallel fibers attached to bones, smooth muscle is typically  organized in   sheets, layers, or bundles   within the   walls of hollow organs .  Figure   48 :   Organization of smooth muscle in tissues .  ➢   Concepts of Organization  •   Smooth muscle is not arranged into fascicles like skeletal muscle .  •   Its arrangement depends on the   mechanical function   of the organ.  •   It may be organized in   circular ,   longitudinal ,   oblique , or even   spiral layers   to  coordinate complex movements   like peristalsis, sphincter closure, or uterine  contractions.  ➢   Layered Arrangements in Hollow Organs  The   most   common   and   functionally   significant   arrangement   is   the   dual - layered  structure :  A.   Inner Circular Layer  •   Muscle fibers   are arranged in a circular manner   around the lumen   of the organ.  •   When these fibers   contract , they   narrow the lumen   of the organ.  •   Found in:  o   Esophagus, intestines   (peristalsis)  o   Blood vessels   (vasoconstriction)  o   Bronchi   (bronchoconstriction)  o   Iris of the eye   (pupil constriction)  Function : Decreases lumen diameter, important for   propulsion and restriction of flow .  B . Outer Longitudinal Layer  •   Fibers run   along the length   of the organ.  •   When these fibers   contract , they   shorten the organ .

C . Additional Oblique or Spiral Layers (in some organs)  •   Present in organs that require   multi - directional movement or force .  •   Example:   Stomach  o   Has   three layers : inner oblique, middle circular, outer longitudinal.  o   This enhances the   churning and mixing   of food with digestive enzymes.  Example: GI Tract Wall  Layer   Smooth Muscle Arrangement   Function  Mucosa (innermost)   —   Secretion and absorption  Muscularis mucosae   Thin   circular smooth muscle   Maintains mucosal tone  Muscularis externa   Inner circular + outer longitudinal   Peristalsis   and   segmentation  Serosa/Adventitia   —   Outer connective tissue  Between the two layers of the muscularis externa lies the   myenteric (Auerbach’s) plexus ,  part of the   enteric nervous system , which controls smooth muscle contractions.  ➢   Functional Importance of Layering  Organ   Layer Arrangement   Function Enabled  Esophagus   Circular + longitudinal   Propel food toward stomach via peristalsis  Intestines   Circular + longitudinal   Mix and move contents along tract  Uterus   Circular + longitudinal (dense  meshwork)  Strong, multidirectional contractions during  childbirth  Urinary  bladder   Interwoven network   Uniform contraction to expel urine  Stomach   Oblique + circular + longitudinal   Churning and mixing food with enzymes  Blood vessels   Circular only (mainly)   Control of vessel diameter (blood pressure  regulation)  Iris of eye   Radial and circular layers   Pupil dilation and constriction  ➢   Microscopy of Smooth Muscle Organization  A.   In Longitudinal Section:  •   Muscle cells appear   long and fusiform , with   elongated nuclei .  •   Layers are seen   running in a single direction   (depending on the organ section).  B.   In Cross - section:  •   Cells appear   circular or oval , with or without visible nuclei depending on the cut.  •   Multiple layers   appear stacked concentrically in tubular organs.

Multi - Unit   Smooth   Muscle :   Multi - unit   smooth   muscle   consists   of   independent  smooth muscle fibers , each with its   own motor neuron innervation . There are   few or  no gap junctions , so each cell   contracts independently   of its neighbor.

It is the   main tissue of the  nervous system , which includes the   brain ,   spinal cord , and   peripheral nerves .  Nervous tissue is highly specialized for:  •   Communication  •   Integration  •   Coordination of bodily functions  It accomplishes this through two main types of cells:  a)   Neurons   –   the excitable, signal - transmitting cells  b)   Neuroglia (Glial cells)   –   the supporting, insulating, and protective cells  Neurons   send and receive signals;   neuroglia   take care of them.  a)   Neurons :   Neurons , also known as   nerve cells , are the   fundamental units of the  nervous system . They are specialized for the   generation ,   conduction , and   transmission  of   electrical and chemical signals   throughout the body.  Neurons serve three major roles:  •   Receiving stimuli   from internal and external environments  •   Processing (integrating)   the information  •   Sending signals   to effectors (muscles, glands, or other neurons)  These cells form   complex neural networks   that underlie everything from reflexes to  thoughts.  ➢   Histogenesis   (Origin of Neurons)  •   Embryologically, neurons are derived from the   ectoderm , specifically from the  neural tube   and   neural crest .  •   Neuroblasts   differentiate into mature neurons, which   lose their ability to divide  after development (except in specific brain regions like the hippocampus).  ➢   Structure of a Neuron :   Neurons are   highly polarized , meaning their structures are  functionally and structurally distinct .

Cell Body (Soma / Perikaryon)  Description :  •   The   central metabolic hub   of the neuron.  •   Contains:  o   A large,   pale nucleus   with a prominent   nucleolus   (for high RNA synthesis)  o   Nissl bodies   –   stacks of rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) rich in ribosomes  o   Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, lysosomes, and other organelles  Function :  •   Synthesizes neurotransmitters and proteins  •   Maintains cellular integrity  •   Integrates incoming signals (with dendrites)  Nissl   bodies   are   unique   to   neurons   and   are   responsible   for   the   synthesis   of  neurotransmitters.  ii . Dendrites  Description :  •   Short, tapering, branched   extensions from the soma  •   Often covered with   dendritic spines   (sites of synaptic input)  •   Typically   unmyelinated  Function :  •   Receive impulses   from other neurons or sensory receptors  •   Transmit these   graded potentials   toward the soma  A single neuron may have   thousands of synapses   on its dendrites, enabling complex  integration of information.  iii . Axon (Nerve Fiber)  Description :  •   A   long, cylindrical projection   from the axon hillock  •   One axon per neuron , but it may branch (axon collaterals)  •   Ends in   axon terminals   or   synaptic boutons  Function :

Historical Note :   The word   “glia”   is derived from the Greek word for   “glue,”   reflecting  early beliefs that these cells simply held neurons together. Today, we understand they  perform   many   more   functions ,   including   regulating   synapses,   myelination,  homeostasis , and   immune defense .
